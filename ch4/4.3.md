I think that is an acceptable trade-off. This is indeed an optimization when we do not care about the evaluation order of subexpressions.
When an expression refers to and change the same object, we can always: 
  - seperate that expression into several expressions to avoid the bad situation of affecting the same object
  - involve the four operators `&&`, `||`, conditional operator `?:`, and the comma `,` operator to enforce the evaluation order
  - remember the exception when the subexpression that change the operand is itself the operand of another subexpression, then it is okay to change the value of an operand and use that operand elsewhere in the same expression.
