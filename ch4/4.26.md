 * @Description: notice the minimum size of int and long int.
--> 
The standard guarantees the minimum size of `int` is 16 bits, and the minimum size of `long` is 32 bits. Since the teacher has 30 students in a class, which needs at least 30 bits, `int` would be not enough to hold all the results. (depending on the machine implementation)
