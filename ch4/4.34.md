 * @Description: Notice the promotion from char to int
--> 
(a) `fval` is converted to `bool`.
(b) `ival` is converted to `float`, then added to `fval`, finally the result is converted to `double`.
(c) `cval` is promoted to `int`, then multiplied by `ival`, then the result is converted to `double`, then added to `dval`.
