(a) `ptr != 0 && *ptr++`

The expression means if `ptr` is not null pointer, then point to whatever next in memory and return a copy of the original ptr. Then it dereferences the original ptr. Looks correct.

(b) `ival++ && ival`

The expression first increases the value of `ival` and **return a copy of the original value, then if the original value is nonzero, the right hand operand `ival`(the incremented one) is evaluated**, if it is also nonzero, the expression is `true`, else it is `false.

(c) `vec[ival++] <= vec[ival]`

The order of evaluation of `<=` operator's operands is undefined. The expression should be:

    ++ival;
    vec[ival] <= vec[ival + 1];
