 * @Description: evaluation order in logical operators
--> 
The logical `AND` and `OR` operators follow the _short-circuit evaluation_ strategy. Which means:
  - they always evaluate their left operand before the right,
  - the right operand is evaluated _if and only if_ the left operand does not determine the result.

The equality operator evaluates both the left operand and the right operand, then compares those values. **The order of evaluation of the two operands is undefined**.
