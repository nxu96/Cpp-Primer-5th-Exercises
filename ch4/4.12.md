 * @Description: Notice the precedence of != and <
--> 
**The expression `i != j < k` is the same with `i != (j < k)`.** (refer to the table in section 4.12)
First, `j < k` is evaluated and the result is a `bool`(either `true` or `false`).

Second, `i != true` or `i != false` is evaluated. Since `i` is an `int`, the `bool` will be converted to `int`, which means `i != 1` or `i != 0` is evaluated.
It is usually a bad idea to use the boolean literals `true` and `false` as operands in comparison. These literals should be used only to compare to an object of type `bool`.
